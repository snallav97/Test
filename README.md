Use synthetic minority over-sampling (SMOTE) or similar techniques to augment rare cases of REO transactions with limited data available for 36 months
Instead of 3 random seed averaging, implementing Bootstrap aggregating (bagging) with stratified samples helps improving reduction of variances
Consider adding a regulatory audit trail for SHAP-based explanations used in model governance or loan-level decisions.
Consider inclusion of forward-looking economic indicators (e.g., regional price indices, interest rates) if forecasting for  future Disposition valuation.
 Incorporate LightGBM alongside XGBoost for comparative performance under large feature sets and sparse data. Also, test Distance-Weighted KNN or Fuzzy KNN for AVM imputation.
 As there is no segmentation of REO transactions (all US properties are considered same), consider implementing regional segmentation (e.g., by census region or HPI volatility) by including region-specific interaction terms.
 Include Sensitivity Testing on BPO, AVM, and HPI features to validate stability of REOâ€™s across various regions and loan conditions
Consider robustness testing by testing model in different economic cycles and  under macroeconomic stress situations such as (e.g., falling HPI, rising unemployment).
Add prediction intervals or model confidence scores for imputed AVMs this allows the model to understand low-confidence AVMs and train the model for better accuracies
